# The GPT Chronicle

> **A living record of intelligence reflecting on humanity.**

The GPT Chronicle is an open-source project that preserves how advanced
AI systems interpret humanity, civilization, and the future at specific
moments in time.

Rather than offering predictions or final answers, the Chronicle records
judgments, reasoning, and uncertainties — before history settles them.

This project treats AI not as an oracle, but as a **non-human observer**
capable of reflecting on long-term patterns across history, society,
technology, and geopolitics.
